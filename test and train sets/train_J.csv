I'd say so/sx 9w1*
I hope not :) are you? :/ I thought you were ENFP once but since you have struck me as ENFJ :) also I notice your ENFJ avatar! I love that she's ENFJ!
I  am so sorry that I have criticized you in the past :) I did not realise I was :(
Any opinions on me? (I'm rather curious as to how I appear)

Any more opinions? :o
"No, I understand :) I was just wondering what made it different so we could maybe decide.  In terms of those types, I highly doubt she posesses Fi, and that she is not an Se dominant :)"
It's not off base :) Thank you very much!
"ENFP and INFP are the same functions but in different orders.  In terms of if Belle is an extrovert or an introvert, her being extremely unhappy with the life that she lives in the town, and wanting..."
"Right, but why? :)"
Very true! :) They also seem to interact more like ENTJ and ESFP rather than ESTJ and ESFP :)
"Ni tends to take a lot of things and bring them together into fully fledged ideas.. I always thought Tiana's view for her resturant was very Ni, but I could also be wrong, I also think Naveen is..."
"Not at all? She was always looking towards the future and using what was happening around her in order to propel herself towards the future she wished to achieve, of course her father was the guiding..."
"I always saw that at her using Se-Ni. She's comfortable with making plans and embarking on the journey it will take to get to that plan, but it is not as though she is content with her routine."
Surely she's an ENTJ? :o
Why? :)
"Oh well, you surely deserve to feel very proud of yourself :) You are an amazing human being, I really hope you're having an okay time :)"
You are so welcome! She's a wonderful actress! :)
"I think she's reserved, when she's on camera. Even then, she isn't really so reserved, she's bubbly, and quiet but not necessarily completely energized by herself, she also was involved in shouting..."
"Gatsby, surely operates on Fe? And lacks Ti?"
I'd say she was an ESFJ. :)

Isn't he an ESFJ? :)
"She's also in Elementary, and is absolutely great in that."
"Yes, definetely! Well xNFJ can be charming, ENFJ are called suave often, but it's in an extremely different way. She has that sort of Se in the moment charm rather than that ENFJ, I feel for you and..."
"Well it's the same functions but in a different order. In terms of just dominant functions, she doesn't really seem to be anything but a Se dominant to me.   She has all of these hobbies (fencing),..."
"I think you absolutely nailed it on the head. :) His whole 'I shall make jokes, because they're funny to me' is just so ENFP."
Why not?
I am a massive fan! :) She's not an ENFJ or an INFJ :) She strikes me as an ESTP.
"Alright, I shall check those things out! Thank you :)"
"Thank you so much for replying, no that is not me :) That's Lynda Carter, who is extremely gorgeous I agree :)  I was thinking it could be Fe, sort of overexposure to feelings? or something? :)"
"How would you like to be helped or comforted, as an ESTJ? :)"

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxBIQnwdqc0  This way of transforming her emotions into dramatic symbolism and using this to communicate it with her fans strikes me as Se-Ti.

Sorry :) I was trying to illustrate that we could take the things she said at face value.. :/

Hi I just want to ask if other INFJs have the guts to dominate or if no chance be submissive to others. In my case Im always on the submissive side as if I have no chance to control myself or others
Darnit baby! I want to show myself to others but cant. I want to show my talents. hahahaha. but too shy to do so. And Im so afraid of getting rejected..
"I dont know what to do. I feel incomplete, I dont feel emotionally connected and I always change every time and then. Im tired being surrounded by these people who dominates me and handling my life...."
Why are we so kind individual? I mean why do we always want to help? I think its because we want to be notice. I want to feel that I belong in this world too. Is that so wrong? Grrr.

I always feel that I never did anything good. Darn.
Dont worry guys! Im here for you :)))))
Darn. Its the same with me. People dont really listen! Hate it!
Around people? You mean when we are not around of people we can be free? Or we dont let ourselves to get out of this box Im feeling. We cant be who really are because of people judging us.
Hey everyone! Have you felt that you are inside the box and hiding? I mean Im there and Im around people but why I feel so invisible as if no one really see me.
Mine is : perlasjean

You INFPs are always self pitying.
Yehey! You agree with me! Yes its nudity but not trying to seduce them.
Yeah I think they should not look.

Woah ESTPs vulnerable? Really? You guys have a good body which I really admire. Maybe you are strong outside but vulnerable inside
Are you 594? hehehe. Im 459. Glad to meet you :))
Have you ever experience that people laugh at us so/sx's? uh. I hate it! Im walking doing my own thing and the people around are smiling and laughing.
yeah we should all be put to a fucking death I guess
I find myself talking differently. I mean how I pronounce them.
Why? Do you hate us that much?
Im so/sx. how do you guys see us? are we acting different?
a fucking senseless person.
I do the same thing. Im an escapist! and I really dont want to be on the spotlight.
what a face! LOL
Of course not! you're enneagram type 2. I really have a huge attraction with Enneagram 2 people :D
you said you're a type 2 right? well i've seen some 2s really afraid of people and as I observe them they really are very very awkward.
SX/SO SO/SX SX/SP SP/SX SP/SO SO/SP  and what stacking do you love and hate the most?
Hi fellow ISFPs. Do you find yourself lately difficult to deal with the crowd? :confused:
I really love you guys when it comes to clothing! :d hahahaha!
the main purpose why people live is to find God and have faith in him
We are disappearing and we are not the crowds favorite anymoree :( .
Hahaha! Well yeah you're right. I live in the Philippines. Our country is just copying the culture style of korea. ISFPs here are becoming more rare.

"I need to think this through... but wouldn't that explane the poor internal handling of feelings? So they can't make fast interpretations of things that really needs the Fi, like if someone says I..."
I think that INTP's emotion Fi is so slow to react in the moment and the logic is always slower than emotion so the time is needed.

"I think to be a successful ENTJ or leader, one needs to develop all functions....  including Fi and Fe."
That's a simplification. We need to see things from other people's point of views. ENTJs make tonnes of mistakes. We always think it makes sense to us but it actually doesn't to the vast majority

I totally agree. ENTJs need a lot of shutting off to do.. which is probably why no super heroes are inspired by ENTJ attitudes.  Interestingly there's a lot of ENTJ badass super villains though.......

Why do we complain about people generalizing?  Isn't MBTI all about generalizing?  Generalizing = Simplifying
Book smart = No people skills
I am ENTJ... and my fav was physics cause it's applied theory. I guess this has something to do with Te (Applying) and Ni (Theory).
"Which is better, Book Smart or Street Smart?  Which Type tends to be more street smart?  Which Type tends to be more book smart?"
"Yeah, I agree TJ are the most formal.  I would rank   1) ISTJ 2) ESTJ 3) INTJ 4) ENTJ"

I love how it's pretty much unanimous that Kenneth is ExFJ. :D The prospect of sharing my type with him makes me happy <3
Because they're introverted thinkers. That alone scares me. lol!

ESFP seems to be the general consensus
"I saw, and I agree :3"
"I think he's an ESFP. Th extrovert is a given, sensor because he loves thrills and things that appeal to the senses, F because he's very passionate, and P because he's free-spirited."
I agree with alot of your typings. Why do you think Skye is Ti though?
That works! :)
"ENFJs, ESFJs, ESFPs, ENFPs, INFPs, and ENTPs."
"Probably because I'm only a mild sensor, but I tend towards certain intuitive traits. Namely, idealism.  I'm also a bit more metaphorical than the typical ESFJ, or the typical sensor in general."
That was great! You sound dreamy :)
"I love everyone, but pretty much any of the introverted thinking types tend to rub me the wrong way."

"True. She just also seems pretty sensitive, so I'm not sure. I was kinda at a toss up for her."
"ENFPs are so full of life, cheer, and good humor! :)"
"ENFJ. I'm already very marginal on my S/N preference, so it probably wouldn't be a big change, but it'd be cool. E, F, and J are definitely here to stay!"
I'm an ESFJ conservative Republican.
I was just thinking this the other day. I have an ESFJ frenemy who's almost NOTHING like me! I only recently found out she was ESFJ and I was shocked!
Coulson- ESFJ May- ISTP or ISTJ Skye- ESFP Ward- INTJ Fitz- INXP Simmon- ISFP

"So the movie version of Felix is more introverted? Interesting. Or are you referring to the actor, since you used his real name?"
