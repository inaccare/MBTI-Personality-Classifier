Definitely not. I would never forget if I was romantically interested. Plans/scheduling is REALLY important to ESTJs.
Hell no. I think we're one of the most direct personality types. I find it really difficult to not voice how I feel. I also find it very difficult to omit/hide things.

I kind of feel sick when I act extroverted.
While the zodiac its self is bullshit; you lost all of your remaining merit when you said INTx.
I'm loud.
"Why INFJ? And ENFP, because Tennat.(Or at least it looks like Tennant)"
I'm back; I have the camwhore urge coming on. http://snaps.htmlchat.net/?img=13072312311120747271y3ly
"ENFP, because cute animal.  And who's dumber? The esfj, or the esfp?"
"It was made with flash; MS Paint doesn't have smoothing.  And esfj, because you're a woman. (not sexist in the least.)"

Why can't you decide on anything?!

Enfp's are pretty cool. Kind of hard to say anything bad about them. 78057
"BUT HOW CAN YOU HAVE TI AND NI?! Someone, please, explain, please."
Both your judging function and your perceiving function are introverted. what.
"Si, the function of being close minded."
I have no idea what that means.
"*Chuckle* He think's he has ti. HE DOESN'T KNOW IT, BUT HE'S AN INTP IN DENIAL! EDIT: I was ninjad. And intp, please, do something with your life."

CEO (big picture) vs Middle Manager (by the book) vs Athlete (experience junky/live in the moment)
Here's how I remember it: Alex (ISTP)  Soso (ENFP) Red (xNTJ)  Mendez (ESTP) Mendoza (ESFx) Sister Ingalls (ENFJ)  Caputo (ESFP)  Luschek (ISTP)  Bennett (ISFJ)
I think INTJs' more developed tertiary Fi works for them as a moral compass and an important decision making tool. It also can make them more artsy/sentimental (think INFPs and enneagram 4s).'

John Mayer - Vultures
Huge fan here. I can relate to a lot of his songs. I admire how confessional his music is and the fact that it has such a unique sound compared to most rap/hip-hop.
I don't really look like any but I've gotten the Smallville guy a few times.

The tertiary function is developed decently enough. The inferior function is used in bursts because it's hard to control. You're either a mistyped ISTJ or you're not adept at analyzing yourself.
Lol. What subjects that aren't taught do you wish were taught?
You sound like a very successful ESTP. Your Ti must've been very well developed.
"Ah, I figured. My ISTJ father never liked subjective things like the Arts either. ENTPs like it more because we're Ne dominant and we like to play around with ideas and be creative."
