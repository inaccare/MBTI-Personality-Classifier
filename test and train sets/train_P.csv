The tertiary function is developed decently enough. The inferior function is used in bursts because it's hard to control. You're either a mistyped ISTJ or you're not adept at analyzing yourself.
Lol. What subjects that aren't taught do you wish were taught?
You sound like a very successful ESTP. Your Ti must've been very well developed.
"Ah, I figured. My ISTJ father never liked subjective things like the Arts either. ENTPs like it more because we're Ne dominant and we like to play around with ideas and be creative."

I would never be anything else than an ISFP ! But i'll admit that i sometimes wish that i could have the people skills of an ENFJ or the efficency of an ESTJ but at the end of the day i love myself...

I think the biggest difference is that Fe accuses Fi of being uncooperative and unsympathetic while Fi accuses Fe of being unauthentic and hypocritical.

Both ENTP and INTP could be considered the Jack of all trades in my opinion. *Cricket sounds*

I've read a book with a similar idea except done in a much better way.

I just enjoy ENTPs in general.

Procrastination will be perpetrated by the INTP up until the last minute unless the INTP is stimulated by an outside force or the activity being done is being used to procrastinate another project.

Spend all of your allotted time to accomplish something procrastinating and then ask for more time. This works best if you have already asked for more time at least once before.
What sucks is getting stuck on what the meaning of life is and being unable to come up with an answer and thus entering into a never ending existential crises. Nothing gets you motivated for the day...
