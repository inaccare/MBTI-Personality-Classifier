Frog Palette for me!
You guys have beautiful eyes - very inviting!

Still sounds like an ENFJ to me. I know I prefer concrete examples over theoretical examples. I think it has more to do with Fe than Ni/Si. I like concrete examples because I can relate them to...

I'd say so/sx 9w1*
I hope not :) are you? :/ I thought you were ENFP once but since you have struck me as ENFJ :) also I notice your ENFJ avatar! I love that she's ENFJ!
I  am so sorry that I have criticized you in the past :) I did not realise I was :(
Any opinions on me? (I'm rather curious as to how I appear)

This is the opposite for me.. When I watch TV programs I feel so much secondhand emotion I may cry.

Any more opinions? :o
"No, I understand :) I was just wondering what made it different so we could maybe decide.  In terms of those types, I highly doubt she posesses Fi, and that she is not an Se dominant :)"
It's not off base :) Thank you very much!
"ENFP and INFP are the same functions but in different orders.  In terms of if Belle is an extrovert or an introvert, her being extremely unhappy with the life that she lives in the town, and wanting..."
"Right, but why? :)"
Very true! :) They also seem to interact more like ENTJ and ESFP rather than ESTJ and ESFP :)
"Ni tends to take a lot of things and bring them together into fully fledged ideas.. I always thought Tiana's view for her resturant was very Ni, but I could also be wrong, I also think Naveen is..."
"Not at all? She was always looking towards the future and using what was happening around her in order to propel herself towards the future she wished to achieve, of course her father was the guiding..."
"I always saw that at her using Se-Ni. She's comfortable with making plans and embarking on the journey it will take to get to that plan, but it is not as though she is content with her routine."
Surely she's an ENTJ? :o
Why? :)
"Oh well, you surely deserve to feel very proud of yourself :) You are an amazing human being, I really hope you're having an okay time :)"
You are so welcome! She's a wonderful actress! :)
"I think she's reserved, when she's on camera. Even then, she isn't really so reserved, she's bubbly, and quiet but not necessarily completely energized by herself, she also was involved in shouting..."
"Gatsby, surely operates on Fe? And lacks Ti?"
I'd say she was an ESFJ. :)
"Hahaha, that's very true. I could see him as having dominant Fe though, however.  Does he lack Si? I don't know, perhaps his planning could come out in things like his whole tirades against Harry,..."
Isn't he an ESFJ? :)
"She's also in Elementary, and is absolutely great in that."
"Yes, definetely! Well xNFJ can be charming, ENFJ are called suave often, but it's in an extremely different way. She has that sort of Se in the moment charm rather than that ENFJ, I feel for you and..."

"I think you absolutely nailed it on the head. :) His whole 'I shall make jokes, because they're funny to me' is just so ENFP."
Why not?
I am a massive fan! :) She's not an ENFJ or an INFJ :) She strikes me as an ESTP.
"Alright, I shall check those things out! Thank you :)"
"Thank you so much for replying, no that is not me :) That's Lynda Carter, who is extremely gorgeous I agree :)  I was thinking it could be Fe, sort of overexposure to feelings? or something? :)"
"How would you like to be helped or comforted, as an ESTJ? :)"

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxBIQnwdqc0  This way of transforming her emotions into dramatic symbolism and using this to communicate it with her fans strikes me as Se-Ti.
"I don't understand why tertiary Fe, can't be strong? While performing surely the main functions she will be using will be Se and Fe, which seems to suggest really realizing and connecting with her..."
Sorry :) I was trying to illustrate that we could take the things she said at face value.. :/

'INTP because you're paranoid and logical and have a beard
ENTJ because I'm not really bothered to think of a reason.
Yea yea I get ya. Depending on a lot of things but let's say for example age you might decide to be more honest when testing yourself and/or have grown up to know yourself better.

@tanstaafl28  Ok then. Growing up and all the responsibilities changes people.
Agree with that but what I'm interested in is how did you come to learn?

"Where do you ISFPs hide tho? o.O Haha... I've only ever met one ISFP, so I can't really tell you-- BUT I'm curious as well."
Definitely not. I would never forget if I was romantically interested. Plans/scheduling is REALLY important to ESTJs.
Hell no. I think we're one of the most direct personality types. I find it really difficult to not voice how I feel. I also find it very difficult to omit/hide things.
For me personally: Restlessness - This usually happens when I'm stuck in a group setting or having to converse with people that I cannot find common ground with (Ex: differing tastes in music that I...

How does that look? Is it draining energy? I could never find common ground with ISTP except only when doing things or solving a problem. I find them to be lacking in emotional depth.

ESFP seems to be the general consensus
"I saw, and I agree :3"
"I think he's an ESFP. Th extrovert is a given, sensor because he loves thrills and things that appeal to the senses, F because he's very passionate, and P because he's free-spirited."
I agree with alot of your typings. Why do you think Skye is Ti though?
That works! :)
"ENFJs, ESFJs, ESFPs, ENFPs, INFPs, and ENTPs."
"Probably because I'm only a mild sensor, but I tend towards certain intuitive traits. Namely, idealism.  I'm also a bit more metaphorical than the typical ESFJ, or the typical sensor in general."
That was great! You sound dreamy :)
"I love everyone, but pretty much any of the introverted thinking types tend to rub me the wrong way."

I'm an ESFJ conservative Republican.
I was just thinking this the other day. I have an ESFJ frenemy who's almost NOTHING like me! I only recently found out she was ESFJ and I was shocked!
