Still sounds like an ENFJ to me. I know I prefer concrete examples over theoretical examples. I think it has more to do with Fe than Ni/Si. I like concrete examples because I can relate them to...

Check out this interview:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVX-M0AgUio  Oozes ENFJness. I can relate SO much.
Hmmm... not like any ESFJ I've ever met. My mom and brother are both ESFJs.
It's all in the hands! His hands do all of the talking.
"Ahhh.. yeah buddy! You're young. You have lots of time to fully embrace all your amazingness. Anytime you need to talk, just PM me or something."

I'd say so/sx 9w1*
I hope not :) are you? :/ I thought you were ENFP once but since you have struck me as ENFJ :) also I notice your ENFJ avatar! I love that she's ENFJ!
I  am so sorry that I have criticized you in the past :) I did not realise I was :(
Any opinions on me? (I'm rather curious as to how I appear)

"Scientific, Sympathetic, Blithe ,Humorous, Fairy :)."
Pardon? :)
This is the opposite for me.. When I watch TV programs I feel so much secondhand emotion I may cry.
"INFP sounds very right, I get a huge amount of Ni dominance from you :)"
"They're all extremely beautiful! I would be most likely to wear, the wave palette! :)"
"Yes, definetely! She almost has that 'fake it till you make it' way about her, and is very talented and aware of it, but she does seem as though she is someone who uses many personas! Also, I..."
"Lovely actress! I thought I saw ENFJ in her but I could be wrong, she might operate on Ni-Fe though :)   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD5y0G6WaSI"
"I've all of a sudden had a huge revelation about Lea Michele, and think that she could be an introvert, she seems to have that sort of forward image and friendliness that a very well adjusted..."
Any more opinions? :o
"No, I understand :) I was just wondering what made it different so we could maybe decide.  In terms of those types, I highly doubt she posesses Fi, and that she is not an Se dominant :)"
It's not off base :) Thank you very much!
"ENFP and INFP are the same functions but in different orders.  In terms of if Belle is an extrovert or an introvert, her being extremely unhappy with the life that she lives in the town, and wanting..."
"Right, but why? :)"
Very true! :) They also seem to interact more like ENTJ and ESFP rather than ESTJ and ESFP :)
"Ni tends to take a lot of things and bring them together into fully fledged ideas.. I always thought Tiana's view for her resturant was very Ni, but I could also be wrong, I also think Naveen is..."
"Not at all? She was always looking towards the future and using what was happening around her in order to propel herself towards the future she wished to achieve, of course her father was the guiding..."
"I always saw that at her using Se-Ni. She's comfortable with making plans and embarking on the journey it will take to get to that plan, but it is not as though she is content with her routine."
Surely she's an ENTJ? :o
Why? :)
"Oh well, you surely deserve to feel very proud of yourself :) You are an amazing human being, I really hope you're having an okay time :)"
You are so welcome! She's a wonderful actress! :)
"I think she's reserved, when she's on camera. Even then, she isn't really so reserved, she's bubbly, and quiet but not necessarily completely energized by herself, she also was involved in shouting..."
"Gatsby, surely operates on Fe? And lacks Ti?"
I'd say she was an ESFJ. :)
"Hahaha, that's very true. I could see him as having dominant Fe though, however.  Does he lack Si? I don't know, perhaps his planning could come out in things like his whole tirades against Harry,..."
Isn't he an ESFJ? :)
"She's also in Elementary, and is absolutely great in that."
"Yes, definetely! Well xNFJ can be charming, ENFJ are called suave often, but it's in an extremely different way. She has that sort of Se in the moment charm rather than that ENFJ, I feel for you and..."
"Well it's the same functions but in a different order. In terms of just dominant functions, she doesn't really seem to be anything but a Se dominant to me.   She has all of these hobbies (fencing),..."
"I think you absolutely nailed it on the head. :) His whole 'I shall make jokes, because they're funny to me' is just so ENFP."
Why not?
I am a massive fan! :) She's not an ENFJ or an INFJ :) She strikes me as an ESTP.
"Alright, I shall check those things out! Thank you :)"
"Thank you so much for replying, no that is not me :) That's Lynda Carter, who is extremely gorgeous I agree :)  I was thinking it could be Fe, sort of overexposure to feelings? or something? :)"
"How would you like to be helped or comforted, as an ESTJ? :)"

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxBIQnwdqc0  This way of transforming her emotions into dramatic symbolism and using this to communicate it with her fans strikes me as Se-Ti.

Sorry :) I was trying to illustrate that we could take the things she said at face value.. :/

"'I'm Type 9 and people in my family (who aren't gut-types) sometimes complain that I 'don't think'. I do feel like I don't really 'think' about certain actions-- I just do them, almost automatically...."
I relate to Anne of Green Gables and Anakin Skywalker. And probably more characters that I can't think of right now. :)
"I am an incredibly slow eater. :'D It's funny, because my mum is the exact opposite. I like to savor my food and avoid choking on it."
I had a lot of nightmares when I was little. I became scared of sleeping because of them. Luckily now I don't dream anymore (or at least I don't remember if I dream).

"Temizzle: Sorry but I'm pretty sure they aren't completely separate characters. Their overall personalities may be different, but they are still the same person. I also don't buy that they have..."
"Also, it seems like people have considered every enneagram type except type 9 for Anakin. Personally I think he's type 8, but what's the reasoning behind him not being type 9?"
"I got Ravenclaw just now... but I was sorted into Slytherin years ago on Pottermore. Can I just be listed as being in Slytherin? I'm quite partial to Slytherin, and the Sorting Hat does take personal..."
I just did an enneagram test for Anakin's personality and got Type 8. I know the tests aren't that accurate but it's a starting point.

"I dream of being a novelist. :) Part of me likes the idea of being famous, but another part shies away from it, because I don't want to be in the spotlight, and I like more the idea of being in the..."
Awesome idea! :) Here's my Goodreads account. Please feel free to add me!
He's definitely not Fi-dom. I don't think he would've been swayed so easily if he was an Fi-dom.
"I haven't seen the Prequel Trilogy so I'm afraid I don't have much to add to this discussion. But, I do think that he has Fi and is a Sensor, at least in the Prequel Trilogy.  Edit: Also, Anakin..."
"So, I've gone through your list and I saw a lot of Te and Si, but hardly any Fe and no Ti. Hope this helps! :)"
"How are you like when you're stressed? That's when the inferior function can be seen. If you figure out your inferior function then you can figure out your dominant function too.  Also, Ne..."
"I know I've already typed myself, but I'm really curious to see what someone else might type me as and why. :)   0. Is there anything that may affect the way you answer the questions? For example,..."
Yikes... I didn't think a personality typing test would ask anything like this!
ESFP has the function stack Se-Fi-Te-Ni.   Se=Extraverted Sensing   Fi=Introverted Feeling   Te=Extraverted Thinking  Ni=Introverted Intuition
"I think I've seen enough to pin-point a personality type. I'm going with INFP, with ENFP (because they are the most introverted extraverts) and ISFP being possible alternatives.     I hope this has..."
"You said that you'd be willing to set aside your morals in a grievous situation. Fi-doms would never, ever think of setting aside their morals/values for anything.           Maybe you could tell us..."
I agree with UnicornRainbowLove. You're probably ENFP.
My interpretation is that you're either an ISTP or INTJ. From what I've read I can tell that you definitely have Se and Ni and you're definitely an introvert. I suspect you have high Ni but I'm not...
"I love how complex Clara is, even if her characterization is all over the place. :) Have no clue what her type is though. I think it's probably either ENFJ or ENTP."
"I don't see Se in Rose. And, Rose isn't in the ideas world? She comes up with a lot of crazy ideas, and she improvises a lot of the time.    She's also more aware of the consequences of her actions..."
My typings: Rose: ENFP  Lissa: ESFJ Dimitri: INxJ Christian: ISxP  Adrian: ESFP  Victor: xxTJ Tasha: ExxP Eddie: ISFJ Janine: xSTJ
"Okay, I've been watching Anne and I'm starting to question my initial typing of Anne as ENFP. INFP seems like a bigger possibility to me now. But... I'm still torn. Is it possible to be an introvert..."
"I'd love to have children one day. I'm not ready for it yet though, so it'll probably happen far into the future, if it happens at all."
This reminds me of the Twelfth Doctor's am I a good man? question in Season 8 of Doctor Who. His answer:   The Doctor: I am not a good man! And I'm not a bad man either. I'm not a hero. I'm...

"I love Life is Strange! :) It's one of my favorite video games. I love how character driven the story is, and how your choices have consequences that can affect you later in the game.   I love..."
"I just ignore it. It's not personal, it's just something they do to get more likes. It doesn't matter to me either way--I'm just there to watch the video."
"I don't care much about shopping centres, or shopping in general. I'd go if I need to buy something, but I don't like going shopping just for the sake of buying something and I don't like to spend..."

"Yeah, I've heard fans say that they weren't as happy with Season 2, mainly because of the lack of intimacy between Jamie and Claire. I wasn't that happy with it either, because of the changes to the..."
I'm INFP 9w1 and I got sorted into Slytherin. :D
If I were you I'd leave and never look back. This relationship sounds really unhealthy. These lines that you wrote (I hope you don't mind me posting them here) really stood out to me:    He just...

Hi I just want to ask if other INFJs have the guts to dominate or if no chance be submissive to others. In my case Im always on the submissive side as if I have no chance to control myself or others
Darnit baby! I want to show myself to others but cant. I want to show my talents. hahahaha. but too shy to do so. And Im so afraid of getting rejected..
"I dont know what to do. I feel incomplete, I dont feel emotionally connected and I always change every time and then. Im tired being surrounded by these people who dominates me and handling my life...."
Why are we so kind individual? I mean why do we always want to help? I think its because we want to be notice. I want to feel that I belong in this world too. Is that so wrong? Grrr.
"I would like to be alone than dealing with people who judge me easily. I enjoy being alone, like this surfing the net, being independent and not relying and bothering other people."
Hm. In my case I always feel like im inside the shell :((
Maybe they were just hurt for judging the child personality
I always daydreaming about me. I am a singer in a concert and the crowds are clapping and enjoying their time listening to my voice. They look like they are really having fun :))) ROFL
I always feel that I never did anything good. Darn.
Dont worry guys! Im here for you :)))))
Darn. Its the same with me. People dont really listen! Hate it!
Around people? You mean when we are not around of people we can be free? Or we dont let ourselves to get out of this box Im feeling. We cant be who really are because of people judging us.
Hey everyone! Have you felt that you are inside the box and hiding? I mean Im there and Im around people but why I feel so invisible as if no one really see me.
Mine is : perlasjean
I cry when people keeps saying I did not good enough where as I did give my best. And when they blame me on their own mistakes :(
Hahaha! You are happy? LOL Well I'd love to join a nude party! Wooooohhh!
Hahaha! You are happy? LOL Well I'd love to join a nude party! Wooooohhh!

Hm. Well I think Im a good person enough. And I choose choices between what is right or wrong. Of course I follow the right things.
"Hehehe. I feel the same way. I dont talk to people I know well. I find them boring or even senseless to talk to. I want to be alone and do what keeps me happy. People will just leave, I think they..."
"Hm. Yeah. I think I change a lot. I dont know Its just Im being so nice and giving to people whom I really care, yet they dont know how to appreciate me."
I think you should leave the house. Hehehe. You dont need your family if they dont understand you or even listen to you. There are thousands of people and you are not alone. Just get a life you know....
You INFPs are always self pitying.
Yehey! You agree with me! Yes its nudity but not trying to seduce them.
Yeah I think they should not look.
What? You think its hot? My parents are telling me to put on clothes. But I really dislike it! Do you think its okay to walk around the house nude?
"Hi everyone! Do you wear clothes? Me, I dont like wearing clothes I feel uncomfortable with clothes that I wear even if they look good on me. I just hate wearing clothes. And I dont wear clothes when..."
Woah ESTPs vulnerable? Really? You guys have a good body which I really admire. Maybe you are strong outside but vulnerable inside
Are you 594? hehehe. Im 459. Glad to meet you :))
Have you ever experience that people laugh at us so/sx's? uh. I hate it! Im walking doing my own thing and the people around are smiling and laughing.
yeah we should all be put to a fucking death I guess
I find myself talking differently. I mean how I pronounce them.
Why? Do you hate us that much?
Im so/sx. how do you guys see us? are we acting different?
a fucking senseless person.
I do the same thing. Im an escapist! and I really dont want to be on the spotlight.
what a face! LOL
Of course not! you're enneagram type 2. I really have a huge attraction with Enneagram 2 people :D
you said you're a type 2 right? well i've seen some 2s really afraid of people and as I observe them they really are very very awkward.
SX/SO SO/SX SX/SP SP/SX SP/SO SO/SP  and what stacking do you love and hate the most?
Hi fellow ISFPs. Do you find yourself lately difficult to deal with the crowd? :confused:
I really love you guys when it comes to clothing! :d hahahaha!
the main purpose why people live is to find God and have faith in him
We are disappearing and we are not the crowds favorite anymoree :( .
Hahaha! Well yeah you're right. I live in the Philippines. Our country is just copying the culture style of korea. ISFPs here are becoming more rare.
Hahaha! Well yeah you're right. I live in the Philippines. Our country is just copying the culture style of korea. ISFPs here are becoming more rare.

"I need to think this through... but wouldn't that explane the poor internal handling of feelings? So they can't make fast interpretations of things that really needs the Fi, like if someone says I..."
I think that INTP's emotion Fi is so slow to react in the moment and the logic is always slower than emotion so the time is needed.
"What I've found out that INTP's are really stubborn. They cannot be persuaded to do things. Usually even small things might be too much, but when you give time to them they will and they really does..."
I suspect that this has something to do with the appropriate challenge. INTP's seem to have this vulnerable feeling inside which they only show when they trust someone with a special way and INFJ's...

As an INFJ this is a small step to relief ;)
So did I get this right; it's a turn on for INTP's if someone is real?
So I was thinking what is the best things to have as INTP in romantic relationships and what are the worst?

ENTJs are knowledge appliers...  So we are book smart but probably spend less time reading. We rather apply what we've learnt more

Sensors = Street Smart  Intuitives = Book Smart

This is the meaning of book smart..... http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTvFQhsFseWBfvGoB692ibwYvETiF6HvDy8DGR3B_hqghcgIWE&t=1&usg=__aJd21dD9Ds7Xie022Hy3f5WVAu4=
Why do we complain about people generalizing?  Isn't MBTI all about generalizing?  Generalizing = Simplifying
Book smart = No people skills
I am ENTJ... and my fav was physics cause it's applied theory. I guess this has something to do with Te (Applying) and Ni (Theory).
"Which is better, Book Smart or Street Smart?  Which Type tends to be more street smart?  Which Type tends to be more book smart?"
"Yeah, I agree TJ are the most formal.  I would rank   1) ISTJ 2) ESTJ 3) INTJ 4) ENTJ"

"But common, you guys love hands on work and hate doing paperwork rightg??. You guys prefer to get your hands dirty, whether it be software programming or physical work, you prefer action."
So Ti loves to solve problems. Yeah it does makes sense. ISTPs just love fixing up mechanical stuff... INTPs probably love more complicated stuff

Huge fan here. I can relate to a lot of his songs. I admire how confessional his music is and the fact that it has such a unique sound compared to most rap/hip-hop.

The tertiary function is developed decently enough. The inferior function is used in bursts because it's hard to control. You're either a mistyped ISTJ or you're not adept at analyzing yourself.
