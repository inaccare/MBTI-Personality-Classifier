Awe such a cutie!   Here is my little girl: Her name is Bailey and she's a total brat.  648834
Come here and I will really make you drool.
Welcome! We wont bite hard unless you want us too.
I'll join you in the corner. We can talk about cats.
*Joins Kajada and the dog* Doggie!
Whoa now.. Just because I like rope and leather and chains doesn't mean I... uh... nvm
*Joins Shade* Wait.. I thought we were leaving the shadows.
I always do!
Probably just you.. I can handle anything. I promise to stop before it actually becomes too much... I need you here for rounds 2-750
If you are drunk that just means I don't have to work as hard to take advantage of you.
"Mmm yes, please do. Also, there is no safe word."
Not all of us come on so strong.. I can bring out the rope later on. <3
Absolutely.   What is your drink of choice?

I'm the fake ENTP..    In one quick moment I lost them both.
It takes a quite a bit to scare me. It's more of a challenge.
So little faith..
I might live in Seattle but I grew up in the country. Never underestimate me.   Does it really count as out-kinking me if you haven't actually done that?  ;)
Cthulhu never looked so hot.
"Well that escalated quickly. Too much kink for me cowboy   *cries* I just wanted a cowboy.,,,"
Any real man will go sub for his lady on occasion
You finally decided after tying me up so many times that you would try it. I promise you babe you are dom 85% of the time.

Yep. The advice I would give here is the same as his last thread. http://personalitycafe.com/istj-forum-duty-fulfillers/823538-28-years-old-never-had-girlfriend-am-i-loser.html
"^^^ This was my first thought.  Also, are there careers performing studies and such where you could use your degree?"
Talk to him about it. Be honest and direct without being confrontational.
^^^ lol... the posts above.  I was married to an ENFP for 19 years.   We spent half of the time debating what she inferred from what I said.
I love to travel. It's one of the few ways I can let go.  I have been to all 50 US states and 30 something countries. In my youth I back-packed around Europe three times.
"Breaking stereotypes... why? I am me. I don't care if other ISTJs are like me, or different.  What if I told you I am Irish and I like to drink? oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo"
"Dude- you are living too much inside your own head. You need to do something outdoorsy... start hiking, camping, bike riding, something.....   BTW, stuff just hurts from time to time."
"Yep, and it's MUCH worse than being alone."
A few items; -Online dating works. Keep trying. Some have forums where you can post your profile and have users critique it. -Try to hang with women whenever possible. This increases your skills......
Be happy for him.  It could be worse. I got a motorcycle AND started jumping out of airplanes again.
#1- I would be comfortable meeting friends and family after the time you gave. But.... I would prefer it NOT be in a big group at a restaurant... even if most are introverts.  I would advise NAY to...

I view being cool about the same as a dog would view a bowl of raw cauliflower.    The instrument has yet to be designed that could accurately measure the depths of my apathy.
"I am not sure I understand. Are you asking if we would see that we are being used? If that is the question, speaking just for myself... yes. I recently ended a relationship for that very reason."
You are who you are. She is what she is. The way you show love was not what she perceives as being love. Some people have needs that many ISTJs cannot give.   Look at it this way- if you are a...
We ISTJs do better in stressful situations when we know what is happening. You should have told him about the issues from your life changing situation so he understood why you got upset so easily. ...
"I am not sure what you mean by drama, but if an ISTJ sees you as an impediment to getting their work done properly, they will not just let things go."
"The key to understanding ISTJs- ask us.... really.    Go to her and ask for 5 minutes to talk. When you get the time to talk, tell her you think there is friction between you two and ask what you..."

First- don't assume. Ask him to take an MBTI test to KNOW if he is ISTJ or not.  Second- make your intentions clear. We tend to respect and respond to directness and clarity.
It's not that an ISTJ will hold back for the purpose of depriving an ENFP. It's that the ENFP needs more communication and on a different level than the ISTJ has to give.  Look at it this way- a...

"I love my ESFJ sister, but she's so EMOTIONAL at times."
I know 3 ISTPs and I don't like any of them much. They all seem so... utterly inert and content to underachieve.

"ISTP one is 100% accurate for me. Eerily accurate, actually."
"You win the internet for the day. Treat yourself to a cookie, please."
Fitting and accurate.  More so than the label PerC has given us.
"Lol, you have got to be kidding... Right.... I can't, for the life of me, understand how people can be so illogical and paranoid.... Why do you get off on demonizing cops?"

All the E types in my experience. Lol
Welcome! :) This is a cool place to learn more about your type.
"Yes, I can entirely relate. I get super attached to my friends too, and I feel this need for them to be equally attached. When I don't feel like they are, insecurities pop up."

You know you're a J when you plan out literally every detail of your day the night before. One of the easiest ways to frustrate you is to spring last-minute plans on you.

"SO TRUE! And then once you've given them the gift, you worry about whether or not they really like it."
All of these. Wow. Lol I thought I was the only one who kept every handwritten letter/card/note of any kind!
If I was forced into it then I'd go willingly -ENFJ friend
ISTP because you used as few words as possible.
"I'm an ISFJ and I'm a Christian. I think this question has more to do with how someone is raised than their personality type, though."
I'm not an ENFJ but I've noticed this about my ENFJ friend. He can't be single. I feel like it's because he can't put up with the loneliness.
"Huh, never thought about it this way but this is definitely true of my ISTP brother. Him and I were never really close until we shared a hobby (swing dancing), and I've noticed that he only makes..."
My ISFJ brother is eerily similar to me. I think he might be a different enneagram type though.
ESFJ because you noticed the use of fuzzy words.
"Yep! I have a penpal. We don't write as frequently anymore since we started college, but we're still in touch, after about 8 years!"
"This, exactly."
"I'm not married yet, but I'm a wanna-be-homemaker!"

"Alright, guess that's just me then haha. I'm hoping time will help me become better at being comfortable with attention.     Okay, this was my other guess as to what you meant :) I've actually..."
(ISFJ here) This made me laugh because it is SO like my ISTP brother!
Hello! :happy:
"Personally, I find INTJ's thoughts and ideas to be quite fascinating when they choose to share them and are willing to continue communicating until I get it."
"[/I][/I]By strong, I meant well-developed. Is it correct to speak in those terms? For instance, would it be right to say I'm an ISFJ with a well-developed T?"

When you take the longer route walking somewhere to avoid having to talk to people you know :P
"Aww, this is why you're so awesome. :D My ENFJ best friend is the first person I'd met who I felt cared about the friendship as much as I did."
Hahaha good one!
I haven't read much about the cognitive functions...guess I should so things will make more sense :)
ENFP sounds to me like it could be right.
I love learning about it too. It's all so fascinating to me. I remember when I first learned about introverts vs extroverts - it really helped me accept myself and my extreme introversion to realize...

congrats!:tongue:

'I am a native speaker in English and French and i've been learning Dutch for the last 3 years.
I would never be anything else than an ISFP ! But i'll admit that i sometimes wish that i could have the people skills of an ENFJ or the efficency of an ESTJ but at the end of the day i love myself...
"ESTJ's, do you get more frustrated with Ti, Fe or Fi?"
"Exactly what i was about to say. Just because a function is is shadowed doesn't mean it is suppresed. EVERYONE uses Fe, Ni, Te,... regardless of function order, it's just that the four first are most..."
ISFJ  Most likely to be liked
"ISFP's can be mysterious in their intentions because they don't always analyze their relationships as much as some IxFJ's do which can be confusing for other types. If i were you, i wouldn't question..."
I don't see how this could be an indication of Fe. Do you mean when he says he wants to be part of a family? Or how he wants to see his mother's family again? At best this could show signs of Fe but...
The fact that OP cares about being popular may simply have to do with being an extrovert or not. I have met several ExFP's who cared about social status just as much as a stereotypical xxFJ would.  ...
"I found Ne really obvious too. For fi, i could show numerous example but the most striking one (for me anyway) seems to be this one: I also have strong believes, and I usually stick to my guns and I..."
"ACTUALLY. I used to think that a lot but then i realized that ExFP's can look a LOT like Fe doms because some of them always care about making others feel comfortable, at ease,... which tends to be..."
To be free from school. Forever.
"Yeah, i don't really get along with them (in general); but i think that the biggest issue between the two types is Fe vs Fi. I've experienced this with my INFJ friend who, despite her great..."
Infp :)
"I love Ni but i have a lot of difficulties understanding.Unlike my other functions, i never imediatly realize i'm using it."
"I suppose some of you may have been surprised when seeing the title since these are two very different types. Yet, i can relate extremely well to both.  Here are my arguments for each:  Type 2w1..."
I think the biggest difference is that Fe accuses Fi of being uncooperative and unsympathetic while Fi accuses Fe of being unauthentic and hypocritical.
Aphrodite was very attracted to beautiful things (and people) which is more of an xSxP thing i guess. She doesn't really seem to use Ti so i vote for xSFP
I started typing with MBTI a week after taking the test but at first i was only basing myself on the four preferences and it took me a month to fully understand the cognitive process. I haven't tried...
Hi! I was wondering if you could list again all the types you just mentioned and write the reasons on why you could be one of these types. Good luck :)
I think it could work well but i've heard that Fi tends to wear off Ti users (of course it's not always the case). In my experience Ne and Se users work well together but you're extroverted side may...
"Maybe you should try to find the root of your mental issues (unless you already know it?). In one of your previous threads, you mention being teased. Is that what made you feel depressed? If you have..."
"I'd like to start first  by saying that i am so sorry for you (break ups are always hard). I completely understand how you're feeling, but if there's anything i've learned in life is that you can be..."
"ISFP  Fi The dominant function of ISFP's, Fi is based on internal values and acts on their own desires.  Se The auxiliary function of ISFP's, Se is very aware of their surroundings, lives in..."
"Welcome :) ! Just wondering, have you taken the cognitive function test ?"
USA:Depends on which state but mostly xSxJ Canada:xSFJ Mexico:ISFJ UK:IxTJ Ireland:ENFP Australia:ESTP New Zealand:ISFJ France:ENTP Switzerland:INTP Germany:ESTP
"Now that you mentioned it, i kinda see it too but i really feel like he's a Fe user."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHOS4bhNGJw  Definitely a Se user (most likely xSTP)
"Young Regina has very strong inner values and is often in touch with her own feelings. Again, this is just a vibe that i got from her which i could be mistaking for Si (Si can easily be mistyped as..."
"1) What is your MBTI type? ISFP  2) What is your gender? Male  3) What type(s) do you admire/respect the most? (Why?) ENFJ: Very smart people, great achievers and very charismatic ESTJ: One..."
Also her need for approval and ability to read people well is very Fe-like. At some point in the show she was so desperate to be loved that she was willing to throw a spell at henry to make him love...
Here are the people i consider to be ESFJ's:  -Oprah (could also be an ENFJ) -Channing Tatum -Hugh Jackman -Halle Berry -SJP -Possibly Zac Efrom -Woody from Toy Story -Snow White
"In a relationship, ESTJ's can be reluctant to change opinions and views they have fixated in the past. But as the relationship becomes deeper and trusting, they may be open to new ideas they have..."
I think it has to do with Te being the auxiliary function and Si the dominant one. The auxilary function is usually held back by the dominant one and tends to process things more internally. Of...
"As an outsider to other people's conflicts, i am very objective and can help in a logical and practical way. In an argument, i'll start panicking, especially when this person has an in your face..."

"Welcome :) INFP's and ISFP's can be extremely similar on the surface due to Fi being their dominant function. Assuming that you're new to this, Fi or introverted feeling is  the dominant function in..."
She is definitely ISxJ. I can't even imagine her being an INFJ. Her Si is so dominant that the only way for her to move on was to runaway from Arendelle and cut loose with everything in relation to...
"Healthy ENFJ's :( They are kind but not too sensitive, smart but not arrogant, organized but not controlling, social but not needy,etc... Of course these are stereotypes but literally every ENFJ i've..."
F I S P but i absolutely hate my I
"I completely understand how you feel but i'm almost sure that your friend didn't mean to hurt your feelings in any way. Maybe you should try talking to him? Us, ISFP's don't always make our feelings..."
I'm surprised that an INFP could be mistyped as an INFJ since these types have zero functions in common (Fi-Ne-Si-Te vs Ni-Fe-Ti-Se). I think that the most likely mistype is an INFJ who is actually...
Yay! Another ISFP :) Welcome.
I don't know for sure...It would sound too cliche to go for freedom so i'm going to chose the money :D
"A few months ago, i used to think i was INFP until i read about the functions and i realized i didn't really relate to Ne. Se and Ni on the other hand, described me more accurately."
"I love XNFP's ! They're so soft spoken and passionate. Even though ENFP's can be insensitive and INFP's a bit unaware of others, they never stop mesmerizing me!"
Thank you so much :D  No more gushiness! I promise :tongue:
Thanks a lot! I'm still not 100% sure but i definitely will take your point in consideration.

Why thank you! i hope someone can help us out here.  But I think INFJ is a very good guess.  INFJ  INFJs take their energy from the inner world of thoughts and ideas. They prefer dealing with...

Well ESFJs love to talk and if someone can bring out their inferior Ti we will enjoy talking to them for hours. I do find that INTPs love to talk just as much as ESFJs. The only difference is that...

I do feel this way from time to time...not with INFPs though. Two of my closest friends are INFPs and we became fast friends.

I'm sorry more ESFJs aren't on this forum to share their insight....
I have two very close INFP friends. I feel I can be very honest with them about who I am.   Although not described in any literature I have read I find the ESFJ is also very idealistic (as is the...

How much bluntness or critism is part of your interactions with ESTJ? I'm trying to figure out if this ESTJ is trying to be helpful or just doesn't like me.
God no. I feel like I can pretend to be an insider but very few people know and accept the real me. It's a lonely feeling living in the past (Si) or being young with conservative values.
"My closest friends are INFP, INTP, INTJ. I love INXXs"
What type are you? INTJ?
Have come to love INTPs.....
I find the ENTJ quite sensitive. By this I mean if they think they can help you with a problem they will. They are also willing to stand up for something they believe is the right thing to do and are...
"I'm an ESFJ and scored 15. I am very sensitive and aware of others emotions, and physical states. I absolutely cannot stand to see animals in any type of confusion or pain....it affects me so deeply..."
I think being an ESFJ sets you up for loneliness. There is a lot of depth to what we feel and not a lot of friends I can truly confide in on a regular basis.

I don't think MBTI is enough for me. I use Si the most of all my functions. Based on this I could be an ISFJ...and sometimes tested as one in terms of cognitive function tests. ESFJs use more Ne...
I'm an ESFJ and can relate to 90% of this. You sound like an ESFJ who has well developed Se as well as Si.
I know an ENFPS who talks a lot like the ESFJ but does not have the same type of filter.....hence my guess that the OP is describing an ENFP.'

ESFP seems to be the general consensus

"I think he's an ESFP. Th extrovert is a given, sensor because he loves thrills and things that appeal to the senses, F because he's very passionate, and P because he's free-spirited."
I agree with alot of your typings. Why do you think Skye is Ti though?
That works! :)
"ENFJs, ESFJs, ESFPs, ENFPs, INFPs, and ENTPs."
"Probably because I'm only a mild sensor, but I tend towards certain intuitive traits. Namely, idealism.  I'm also a bit more metaphorical than the typical ESFJ, or the typical sensor in general."
That was great! You sound dreamy :)
