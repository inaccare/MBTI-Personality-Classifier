"I need to think this through... but wouldn't that explane the poor internal handling of feelings? So they can't make fast interpretations of things that really needs the Fi, like if someone says I..."
I think that INTP's emotion Fi is so slow to react in the moment and the logic is always slower than emotion so the time is needed.

So did I get this right; it's a turn on for INTP's if someone is real?
So I was thinking what is the best things to have as INTP in romantic relationships and what are the worst?

"Some ISTJs are VERY direct, some are not.   Ask him straight out if he wants to break up.   99% he will answer this directly and honestly."
There is a difference in motivation.  An ISTJ will usually do things because he or she sees it as the right thing to do. Whether it pleases someone else isn't normally a factor.  An ISFJ is much...

I am ISTJ; my girlfriend is ISFJ. Sometimes her emotions flow freer than mine and we aren't in sync. Don't take it as a negative as long as you both accept each other's level.  We ISTJs are...

"It is very easy for me, being ISTJ. I don't give my heart permission to get involved. It is probably not so simple for an INFP."

Yep. The advice I would give here is the same as his last thread. http://personalitycafe.com/istj-forum-duty-fulfillers/823538-28-years-old-never-had-girlfriend-am-i-loser.html
"^^^ This was my first thought.  Also, are there careers performing studies and such where you could use your degree?"
Talk to him about it. Be honest and direct without being confrontational.
^^^ lol... the posts above.  I was married to an ENFP for 19 years.   We spent half of the time debating what she inferred from what I said.
I love to travel. It's one of the few ways I can let go.  I have been to all 50 US states and 30 something countries. In my youth I back-packed around Europe three times.
"Breaking stereotypes... why? I am me. I don't care if other ISTJs are like me, or different.  What if I told you I am Irish and I like to drink? oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo"
"Dude- you are living too much inside your own head. You need to do something outdoorsy... start hiking, camping, bike riding, something.....   BTW, stuff just hurts from time to time."
"Yep, and it's MUCH worse than being alone."
A few items; -Online dating works. Keep trying. Some have forums where you can post your profile and have users critique it. -Try to hang with women whenever possible. This increases your skills......
Be happy for him.  It could be worse. I got a motorcycle AND started jumping out of airplanes again.

I view being cool about the same as a dog would view a bowl of raw cauliflower.    The instrument has yet to be designed that could accurately measure the depths of my apathy.
"I am not sure I understand. Are you asking if we would see that we are being used? If that is the question, speaking just for myself... yes. I recently ended a relationship for that very reason."
You are who you are. She is what she is. The way you show love was not what she perceives as being love. Some people have needs that many ISTJs cannot give.   Look at it this way- if you are a...
We ISTJs do better in stressful situations when we know what is happening. You should have told him about the issues from your life changing situation so he understood why you got upset so easily. ...
"I am not sure what you mean by drama, but if an ISTJ sees you as an impediment to getting their work done properly, they will not just let things go."
"The key to understanding ISTJs- ask us.... really.    Go to her and ask for 5 minutes to talk. When you get the time to talk, tell her you think there is friction between you two and ask what you..."

First- don't assume. Ask him to take an MBTI test to KNOW if he is ISTJ or not.  Second- make your intentions clear. We tend to respect and respond to directness and clarity.
It's not that an ISTJ will hold back for the purpose of depriving an ENFP. It's that the ENFP needs more communication and on a different level than the ISTJ has to give.  Look at it this way- a...

"Welcome! Yes, the ISFJ forum tends to be a little quiet. My hunch is that a lot of us lurk.. ;)"
"Yes, I have a few letters that have negative emotions because they remind me of dissolved friendships, but at the same time I can't bear to throw them out!"
"You know you're an ISFJ when your INTJ brother drives you up the wall by saying you said something which you know you did not say. You press the subject because you do not remember saying it,..."
"SO TRUE! And then once you've given them the gift, you worry about whether or not they really like it."
All of these. Wow. Lol I thought I was the only one who kept every handwritten letter/card/note of any kind!
If I was forced into it then I'd go willingly -ENFJ friend
ISTP because you used as few words as possible.
"I'm an ISFJ and I'm a Christian. I think this question has more to do with how someone is raised than their personality type, though."
I'm not an ENFJ but I've noticed this about my ENFJ friend. He can't be single. I feel like it's because he can't put up with the loneliness.
"Huh, never thought about it this way but this is definitely true of my ISTP brother. Him and I were never really close until we shared a hobby (swing dancing), and I've noticed that he only makes..."
My ISFJ brother is eerily similar to me. I think he might be a different enneagram type though.
ESFJ because you noticed the use of fuzzy words.
"Yep! I have a penpal. We don't write as frequently anymore since we started college, but we're still in touch, after about 8 years!"
"This, exactly."
"I'm not married yet, but I'm a wanna-be-homemaker!"

Hello! :happy:
"Personally, I find INTJ's thoughts and ideas to be quite fascinating when they choose to share them and are willing to continue communicating until I get it."
"[/I][/I]By strong, I meant well-developed. Is it correct to speak in those terms? For instance, would it be right to say I'm an ISFJ with a well-developed T?"

"I'm jealous of how ESFJ's can involve ANYONE in a conversation, super easily. You guys are great at making people feel noticed and valuable, even if they're complete strangers. I wish I could force..."
"I think it is an introvert thing to not want to talk, but still want company. My very best friend is an ISTJ, and talking about how similar we are with being perfectly ok with quiet led to us being..."
"Dear ISTP brother,  Thanks for being so laid-back that you instantly make me feel guilty whenever I get irritated with you (which is rare). I do wonder though, how come you get along so easily with..."
When you take the longer route walking somewhere to avoid having to talk to people you know :P
"Aww, this is why you're so awesome. :D My ENFJ best friend is the first person I'd met who I felt cared about the friendship as much as I did."
Hahaha good one!
I haven't read much about the cognitive functions...guess I should so things will make more sense :)
