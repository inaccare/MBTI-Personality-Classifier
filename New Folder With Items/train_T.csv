"I didn't mean to imply that your explanation was impossible, that would be an indefensible position to hold. I merely wished to advance a more simple, evidence-based alternative.  Unfortunately,..."
Oh I don't think you could handle me.
Problem?
I guess I should have explained my point. Your post was ironic because the very existence of the internet is a testament to the ability of science to determine truth.   And saying it goes both...
"ENTJ's are typified by a desire to enforce their will upon their environment; money is the most obvious way to do that, but it's not the only way."
You sound way too confident in your new found enlightenment. I strongly advise you to temper your intuition with a healthy dose of skepticism. The ideas popping into your head are educated guesses...
Need I point out the irony of using the internet to tell people that science is poorly adapted for determining truth?
"You may want to try proofreading your posts for coherence. I'm sure the section I colored blue makes perfect sense to you, but to me it reads like an excerpt from Time Cube.    Yes, an actual..."
Care to elaborate?
"I can tell you that memory is extremely unreliable, and that dreams can easily be confused with actual experiences."

That depends on the attributes of said God.    Is it not dishonest to believe something merely because it's practical to do so?
"What is the meaning of life?  Pointless suffering. The agony endured on our world alone is beyond our comprehension, and it is but one of trillions."
I first encountered MBTI in a business writing class.
"I'd more than likely derive no satisfaction from it. Besides, a predator often targets the weakest of the herd; all it's interested in is eating."
"You asked how to not get bored in a long term relationship, the professor in the comic describes being married to the same woman for 50 years."
"The default response of many authority figures when a subordinate makes demands is I provide you with X, Y, and Z, how dare you demand more?!."
"Just make sure you use an emotional appeal, not a logical argument. The simplest amounts to I'm in charge, do as I say, though that may backfire if you aren't actually in charge."
Scantron is obsolete?!
Just make sure you have a good defense against any accusation of hypocrisy or selfishness.
"No one does that to me in person, at least not more than once....."
Interesting.... Is resolve preferable to reason? Is holding to your beliefs in the face of opposing evidence a virtue?
This certainly isn't unique to INFP's. My ideals were brutalized so badly that I abandoned them altogether. I would be an abomination in the eyes of myself just 5 years ago.

I've read that enfp's have a fascination with people and I've wondered if his obsession with tv might have something to do with that.

You're the king of procrastination!
Is it a common ENFP thing to be obsessed with tv or is just my ENFP? lol

I love esfj's! All of my closest friends are esfj's. I totally get them and they get me!!
My enfp guy loves to hang with girls. He loves hanging with the guys too but really likes friendships with girls more.

Both ENTP and INTP could be considered the Jack of all trades in my opinion. *Cricket sounds*
Your argument is something that a nazi might say and is therefore wrong (Reductio ad Hitlerum).  My other one was an appeal to tradition or if that doesn't work for you there are other fallacies...
I've read a book with a similar idea except done in a much better way.
That is adorable.
INTPs are terrible people.
I just enjoy ENTPs in general.

I enjoy how pretty much every single INTP thread starts off with someone making a joke.
Procrastination will be perpetrated by the INTP up until the last minute unless the INTP is stimulated by an outside force or the activity being done is being used to procrastinate another project.

Spend all of your allotted time to accomplish something procrastinating and then ask for more time. This works best if you have already asked for more time at least once before.
What sucks is getting stuck on what the meaning of life is and being unable to come up with an answer and thus entering into a never ending existential crises. Nothing gets you motivated for the day...
