They could always tell me... would it be okay to discriminate then? And either way I must digress... how do you know who was born into a political community and who joined after reaching adulthood?
Distinction for what? If it's only bad to discriminate when it has to do with factors that a person is born into then by definition that would exclude religious converts.
Great. So according to this it would be okay to discriminate against religious converts... after all it was their choice to convert and their choice to accept those beliefs.

Well that escalated quickly. First we just wanted to castrate violent criminals but now we want to castrate people who haven't committed any crime at all.

"I love my ESFJ sister, but she's so EMOTIONAL at times."
I know 3 ISTPs and I don't like any of them much. They all seem so... utterly inert and content to underachieve.

"I was feeling rebellious, and I'm generally not quite what people expect."
"I wouldn't know, because I've never had strong feelings for anyone. I doubt I would be though. I tend to give people their space and expect it to be reciprocated."

"ISTP one is 100% accurate for me. Eerily accurate, actually."
"You win the internet for the day. Treat yourself to a cookie, please."
Fitting and accurate.  More so than the label PerC has given us.
"Lol, you have got to be kidding... Right.... I can't, for the life of me, understand how people can be so illogical and paranoid.... Why do you get off on demonizing cops?"

"Well, a little of both. But nah, I'm not scared of you yet. You haven't been grumpy with me like most others have!"
I love how it's pretty much unanimous that Kenneth is ExFJ. :D The prospect of sharing my type with him makes me happy <3
Because they're introverted thinkers. That alone scares me. lol!
I'm an ESFJ and I'm very physically sensitive and very huggy

ESFP seems to be the general consensus
"I saw, and I agree :3"
"I think he's an ESFP. Th extrovert is a given, sensor because he loves thrills and things that appeal to the senses, F because he's very passionate, and P because he's free-spirited."
I agree with alot of your typings. Why do you think Skye is Ti though?
That works! :)
"ENFJs, ESFJs, ESFPs, ENFPs, INFPs, and ENTPs."
"Probably because I'm only a mild sensor, but I tend towards certain intuitive traits. Namely, idealism.  I'm also a bit more metaphorical than the typical ESFJ, or the typical sensor in general."
That was great! You sound dreamy :)
"I love everyone, but pretty much any of the introverted thinking types tend to rub me the wrong way."
http://personalitycafe.com/guess-type/220009-brave-little-toaster.html#post6149641 I made a thread like this a little while ago lol
So maybe ENFP?

"True. She just also seems pretty sensitive, so I'm not sure. I was kinda at a toss up for her."
"ENFPs are so full of life, cheer, and good humor! :)"
"ENFJ. I'm already very marginal on my S/N preference, so it probably wouldn't be a big change, but it'd be cool. E, F, and J are definitely here to stay!"
I'm an ESFJ conservative Republican.
I was just thinking this the other day. I have an ESFJ frenemy who's almost NOTHING like me! I only recently found out she was ESFJ and I was shocked!
Coulson- ESFJ May- ISTP or ISTJ Skye- ESFP Ward- INTJ Fitz- INXP Simmon- ISFP
"My mom is an ISTJ and my dad is an INXJ. It's pretty tough being the only extroverted feeler in the household, but I still love my parents and usually try to work out our differences. :)"
I think Cheese Sandwich is an INFP who grew into an ENFP. Maybe XNFP?

"I had her take the test, and she tested as one. And when I meant wrong, I meant when she's doing something that upsets me."
"So the movie version of Felix is more introverted? Interesting. Or are you referring to the actor, since you used his real name?"
"Wow, even though I'm ESFJ, I relate to alot of this! Maybe it's because my S/N preference is so marginal that I have traits from both? :D If so, that's awesome! I get the best of both worlds! xD"

Interesting theories! Thanks for the post! :) I think Nancy might be ISXJ ^_^
I love how sensitive and idealistic INFPs are :)
Interesting! What do you think their other letters are? :)
Thank you for presenting this viewpoint! :)
I think MacDuff from MacBeth was ESFJ :) I also think King Duncan was ENFJ.
