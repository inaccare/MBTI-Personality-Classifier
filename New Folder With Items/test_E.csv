Hello there fellow ENFP! Welcome! :>
"I think I am, I just don't want to say I am and it turns out im not? :S"
"It sounds like he's been hurt a lot here but the chances are he does still have feelings for you he is just really hurt by what was said/done. I would just give him space honestly, he most likely..."
"Its what I've heard from the grapevine. I would also say I would be an example of such as I can just seem/feel quite shy and want to be on my own from time to time, yet I am definitely an extrovert...."
Yeah essentially! ENFPs tend to be the most 'Introverted of the Extroverts' so a lot of the time they tend to get mistaken to be INFPs a lot!
"Okay, going by that comment and the other comments on this thread, I think I'm going to have to also agree for the moment and type him as a ESFP!"
"This one is a bit of a shot in the dark, But can he sometimes seem a bit introverted at times? like will he take moments to have time by himself?"
"I mean, I tend to wear a lot of pastels (mainly pink and white) and girly cute things but I will wear different things but In my own style, Idk :S"
"I say sorry a lot, I even say sorry when I shouldn't. I suppose It has become a habit of mine 0.o"
ohmigoodness why thank you so much!!!! o///o

Hi thanks for your insight. I decided INFP because I tend to be a homebody even in childhood. I suspected INFP at first but then when I learned ENFPs like the most alone time of the Extroverts I...
"I ended up deciding INFP after all. I forgot an important piece of information about myself. That I am more of a homebody and even though I still go out, I prefer being home. So that clinches it for..."
Thanks for your opinion but this is directed to those who came to the conclusion they are INFP and why they think they are.
"Yeah, in the back of my mind I know I shouldn't care about it. And the truth is when it comes down to it I resist being labeled so it's kind of strange but I'm enjoying it for the time being."
"Hi sure I can give more info. Basically I've been studying the cognitive processes and trying to decide based off of that, I've been doing that off and on and took a break for a while. Then picked..."
"I'll agree with what the pp said about cognitive functions but with a bit more tact.  Those descriptions aren't conclusive and several will be conflicting, plus it doesn't take into account each..."
"I'm on the fence about that as well, I think certain types that are depressed can appear to be INFP and mistype themselves as one."
"I see what you mean. Though I go through spurts of being focused on something then I get bored and move on. So while I am doing this now, I won't be around for long, just until I'm done with it. My..."
Hmmm that makes it more in the middle. It's a tough one. I'm refusing to settle for xnfp though. Thank you for your reply.   I was thinking about my sister in law who was typed as a INFP and she's...
"Hey guys, after I posted this I went looking around some more at the other functions and I'm now leaning towards ENFP. The main reason being that it said both are in tune with others which I am, but..."

Booooo
Took a different questionnaire:  1.)What aspect of your personality made you unsure of your type? I am the most unsure about introversion versus extroversion.  I am shy which makes me think of the...
"Yeah that is true and makes it more difficult to decide.. I see what you mean about it being challenging.  You mentioned tertiary, I was thinking about leadership. I can do it and do it when no one..."
"Thanks, I feel better about my thinking results. At first glance it looks odd.  I'm pretty convinced on the NFP as well, I'm actually leaning more towards ENFP now. My sister reminded me yesterday..."
What does it mean when thinking is both so low? Is it supposed to line up with a certain pattern or is it common that not everyone is exactly in the typical order
Very interesting. I decided to take a different functions test and here were my results: Extroverted Intuition (Ne)
