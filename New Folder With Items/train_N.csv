Great story.  I've always thought programming was more of an INTP domain.  How strong is the T in you i.e. are you mildly F?
"Not to sound rude or anything, I just can't comprehend myself how an ISFJ can like programming. Maybe it's the Fe side of programming? like designing GUI, delivering client's expectation and etc......"

What do you mean by realistic?
"When you are studying for an Exam, you can't concentrate when there are small background noises!"

"If you're hanging around in forums like these, I think you're not much of mainstream anymore :)"
"I read somewhere that when a person is stressed out he will resort to his third and forth function; the function he normally ignores. So an ENTJ will become ISFP, and INFP will become ESTJ....etc......"

"I think to be a successful ENTJ or leader, one needs to develop all functions....  including Fi and Fe."
That's a simplification. We need to see things from other people's point of views. ENTJs make tonnes of mistakes. We always think it makes sense to us but it actually doesn't to the vast majority
"After traversing this forum for months, I've learned that ESFJs are the kind of people which ENTJs think are too concerned over the small things on other people.   Imagine if you are both going to..."
I totally agree. ENTJs need a lot of shutting off to do.. which is probably why no super heroes are inspired by ENTJ attitudes.  Interestingly there's a lot of ENTJ badass super villains though.......
"Come on man.. I'm an ENTJ... and I don't think ENTJ's are badass  Name me ONE, just ONE, cartoon or movie heroes which is an ENTJ..."
ENTJs are knowledge appliers...  So we are book smart but probably spend less time reading. We rather apply what we've learnt more
OKay I'm rephrasing  Se users = Street Smart  Does this make sense?
"Haha, just trying"
Sensors = Street Smart  Intuitives = Book Smart

Why do we complain about people generalizing?  Isn't MBTI all about generalizing?  Generalizing = Simplifying
Book smart = No people skills
I am ENTJ... and my fav was physics cause it's applied theory. I guess this has something to do with Te (Applying) and Ni (Theory).
"Which is better, Book Smart or Street Smart?  Which Type tends to be more street smart?  Which Type tends to be more book smart?"
"Yeah, I agree TJ are the most formal.  I would rank   1) ISTJ 2) ESTJ 3) INTJ 4) ENTJ"
"Well Said!  I can see your style of leadership is more towards inspiring people. You try to bring out the best in people  J's like myself, we like to manage. We like making plans and seeing them..."
"Since none of you guys think that Muslims are behind 9/11,  Why is it that you guys hate muslims so much?? + labelling muslims are terrorist??"
May I know what you do for a living and do you enjoy managing?  Most Ps I know hate doing management. They prefer to blend in and just  be a good bloke
"But common, you guys love hands on work and hate doing paperwork rightg??. You guys prefer to get your hands dirty, whether it be software programming or physical work, you prefer action."
So Ti loves to solve problems. Yeah it does makes sense. ISTPs just love fixing up mechanical stuff... INTPs probably love more complicated stuff
"Yeah, possibly. But still, even if the towers did not collapse they would've attacked Afghanistan anyway.  Engineering facts and simulation do prove the controlled demolition theory. There was even..."
What I don't understand is that if it was a controlled demolition.... why do they want the tower to collapse? They can just leave the plane dangling there..... No need to collapse the entire tower to...

"I just read another thread. This guy says that a way to motivate P's is to stimulate their main functions,  Ne = Change their tasks often Se = Give hands on work Fi = Give appreciation Ti = ......."

I also think Satan's ESTP.  The ENTPs on this thread are annoying as expected.
How does one smell like a big one? owo
"Oh come on, have more confidence in yourself!"
We're getting there.  Let's make this thread dirtier.
"Odd question, but does he find you too wild or 'unstable' in our ENFP ways for his tastes?  And if the ISFJ is more short tempered, what was it that held them together?"
"Yeah and saying ESTPs are 'logical' and ENFPs are 'emotional' are basic, cliche MBTI stupidity.  One of my acquaintance definitely likes to to talk a lot, but don't seem to care when I'm the one..."
"Ohhhhhhh dear, we're back to square one with the stereotypes.  I'm surprised ESTPs are lurking on this thread. What were you curious about?"
What doesn't seem wise?  ESTP/ENFP relationship?

"I've always been told I'm rather low maintenance. On dates, I'm usually the one paying for both myself and the guy. :tongue:"
Did you just fart?  Because you blow me away. :crazy:
And I'm surprised that ENTP is pretty popular. I would think Ne doms would eventually sizzle out.
"Holy shit, every option has at least one vote lol. And INFJ is more popular than INTJ? Mindblown! :crazy:  Who voted for ESTP?  What was the relationship like?"
