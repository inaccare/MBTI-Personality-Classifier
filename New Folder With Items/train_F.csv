I'm an ESTP; I don't look long term. Commitments make me dread and to say I HAVE to stay with one girl for the rest of my life I think I'd go crazy.
I've taken that into consideration as well. Maybe I'm not ready or it'd be more wise to wait.

Welcome! :) This is a cool place to learn more about your type.
"Yes, I can entirely relate. I get super attached to my friends too, and I feel this need for them to be equally attached. When I don't feel like they are, insecurities pop up."

You know you're a J when you plan out literally every detail of your day the night before. One of the easiest ways to frustrate you is to spring last-minute plans on you.

All of these. Wow. Lol I thought I was the only one who kept every handwritten letter/card/note of any kind!
If I was forced into it then I'd go willingly -ENFJ friend
ISTP because you used as few words as possible.
"I'm an ISFJ and I'm a Christian. I think this question has more to do with how someone is raised than their personality type, though."
I'm not an ENFJ but I've noticed this about my ENFJ friend. He can't be single. I feel like it's because he can't put up with the loneliness.
"Huh, never thought about it this way but this is definitely true of my ISTP brother. Him and I were never really close until we shared a hobby (swing dancing), and I've noticed that he only makes..."
My ISFJ brother is eerily similar to me. I think he might be a different enneagram type though.
ESFJ because you noticed the use of fuzzy words.
"Yep! I have a penpal. We don't write as frequently anymore since we started college, but we're still in touch, after about 8 years!"
"This, exactly."
"I'm not married yet, but I'm a wanna-be-homemaker!"

"Aww, this is why you're so awesome. :D My ENFJ best friend is the first person I'd met who I felt cared about the friendship as much as I did."
Hahaha good one!
I haven't read much about the cognitive functions...guess I should so things will make more sense :)

I love how it's pretty much unanimous that Kenneth is ExFJ. :D The prospect of sharing my type with him makes me happy <3
Because they're introverted thinkers. That alone scares me. lol!

ESFP seems to be the general consensus
"I saw, and I agree :3"
"I think he's an ESFP. Th extrovert is a given, sensor because he loves thrills and things that appeal to the senses, F because he's very passionate, and P because he's free-spirited."
I agree with alot of your typings. Why do you think Skye is Ti though?
That works! :)
"ENFJs, ESFJs, ESFPs, ENFPs, INFPs, and ENTPs."
"Probably because I'm only a mild sensor, but I tend towards certain intuitive traits. Namely, idealism.  I'm also a bit more metaphorical than the typical ESFJ, or the typical sensor in general."
That was great! You sound dreamy :)
"I love everyone, but pretty much any of the introverted thinking types tend to rub me the wrong way."

"True. She just also seems pretty sensitive, so I'm not sure. I was kinda at a toss up for her."
"ENFPs are so full of life, cheer, and good humor! :)"
"ENFJ. I'm already very marginal on my S/N preference, so it probably wouldn't be a big change, but it'd be cool. E, F, and J are definitely here to stay!"
I'm an ESFJ conservative Republican.
I was just thinking this the other day. I have an ESFJ frenemy who's almost NOTHING like me! I only recently found out she was ESFJ and I was shocked!
Coulson- ESFJ May- ISTP or ISTJ Skye- ESFP Ward- INTJ Fitz- INXP Simmon- ISFP

"So the movie version of Felix is more introverted? Interesting. Or are you referring to the actor, since you used his real name?"
